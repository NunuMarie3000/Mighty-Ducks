## Conflict Plan
* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
 * talking it out, communicating
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
 * speak up, if you feel you're being left out or you feel someone is taking over, tell them
* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
 * Reconvene and talk through, between the three of us, we can have all the knowledge we need, and if we don't, Google does
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
 * We gone say something, same as how we approached a possible person steamrolling the project
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
 * If communication doesn't work, and we can't come to an amicable understanding, instructors may be called in...but only after a brief break for us all to calm down and come back together

* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

 * all of it?
* How will you share the repository with your teammates?
